# My C Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing three C projects that I've worked on. Below, you'll find descriptions of each project along with links to their respective directories.

## Projects

### 1. Project A: Real-Time Data Processing

- **Description:** Project A is a real-time data processing system implemented in C. It involves efficient algorithms for processing streaming data and generating insights in real-time. It's designed to handle large volumes of data with minimal latency.

- **Directory:** [Project 1](Projects/A1)

### 2. Project B: Embedded Systems Development

- **Description:** Project B focuses on embedded systems development using C programming language. It includes firmware development for microcontrollers, sensor interfacing, and communication protocols implementation. The project emphasizes low-level programming and hardware-software interaction.

- **Directory:** [Project 2](Projects/A1)

### 3. Project C: Network Programming

- **Description:** Project C involves network programming in C, with an emphasis on socket programming, TCP/IP protocols, and client-server architecture. It includes implementations of various network applications such as chat servers, file transfer utilities, and network monitoring tools.

- **Directory:** [Project 3](Projects/A1)

## Getting Started
